# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for:

- The latest released version in the `main` branch

If you are using an older version and you believe you found a security issue, please still report it — but you may be asked to upgrade to the latest version to verify the fix.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue with full details of a potential vulnerability.

Preferred reporting path:

- If this repository has GitHub Security Advisories enabled, please report via a **private security advisory**.

If that is not available:

- Contact the project maintainer(s) privately (for example via the email listed on the maintainer’s Git hosting profile).

If you cannot find any private contact method:

- Open a minimal public issue requesting a private channel, without including sensitive details.

## What to include

- A clear description of the issue and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept where appropriate)
- Affected version(s) / commit SHA
- Any relevant environment details

## Response timeline

The maintainers aim to:

- Acknowledge reports within 7 days
- Provide a status update as investigation proceeds

Timelines may vary depending on complexity and maintainer availability.
